## Usage
- Download and copy the ProKeysPreview.vst3 folder to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3` or wherever REAPER looks for your VST3 files
- Add the Plugin to the FX for the Expert Pro Keys track

## Build
This project uses Projucer and JUCE 8.0.12.

1. Initialize the JUCE submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Open `ProKeysPreview.jucer` in Projucer and save, or run Projucer headless. If you only have JUCE source, build Projucer from `JUCE/extras/Projucer` first.

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
JUCE\extras\Projucer\Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\App\Projucer.exe --resave ProKeysPreview.jucer

# macOS
./JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/MacOSX/build/Release/Projucer.app/Contents/MacOS/Projucer --resave ProKeysPreview.jucer

# Linux
./JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/LinuxMakefile/build/Projucer --resave ProKeysPreview.jucer
```

3. Build the generated projects:

```bash
# Windows
msbuild Builds/VisualStudio2026/ProKeysPreview.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64

# macOS
xcodebuild -project Builds/MacOSX/ProKeysPreview.xcodeproj -configuration Release -target ProKeysPreview

# Linux
make -C Builds/LinuxMakefile CONFIG=Release
```

REAPER SDK headers are included in `Source/extern` under the original license.

## Settings
- Difficulty
    - The plugin assumes it has been placed in the FX window of the Expert difficulty.
    - When placed here, you can switch to the other tracks using the Difficulty setting, which automatically adjusts track speeds.
    - Alternatively, you can place the plugin on all the different tracks and use the `This track` difficulty, which won't adjust the track speed.
- Time Offset (ms)
    - The plugin will have some latency. It's likely to be different from RBN Preview.
    - Adjust until playback looks accurate.
- Refresh Rate (Hz)
    - This is how often the plugin updates. It is recommended to use the refresh rate of your display.
- Speed
    - This is the track speed.
    - It is designed to be equivalent to Rock Band 3 track speeds.
